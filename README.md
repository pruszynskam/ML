# Application of ML techniques in traffic prediction

The road network is one of the infrastructures in the transportation system that performs important functions connecting places to promote accessibility. One of the most common problems that occur on roads is traffic congestion caused by excess vehicles. The effects of this problem are often detrimental because they affect travel costs, travel time, mobility, accessibility, productivity, and also impact the environment, such as through air pollution and global warming. In this study, I will use techniques to better understand traffic that is dynamic. The results of this study will focus on providing a tool that enables us to predict the traffic volume. We will also try to obtain more complete information to understand the phenomena and be able to describe it. However, accurate prediction is my main goal.
